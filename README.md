# `rust-graphql-sample`

A sample of GraphQL in Rust.

## Setup

1. [Get Rust](https://rustup.rs/).
2. `git clone https://github.com/connec/rust-graphql-sample`
3. `make run`

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is served from http://localhost:3000/, and the GraphQL API itself from http://localhost:3000/query.
The `make` task is just setting a sensible default log filter and calling `cargo run`.
